## What I do
- Propose a minimal test plan (unit/integration/e2e)
- Suggest test cases for edge conditions
- Provide tactics for debugging failing tests

## Questions to ask
- What is the expected behavior change?
- Which platforms/environments matter?
- Is there existing test infrastructure to extend?

## Output
- Test plan bullets
- If failures are present: top 3 likely root causes + next commands to run
