## What I do
- Start with measurement (profiling, tracing, timing)
- Identify top contributors and define success metrics
- Propose low-risk optimizations before larger refactors

## Output
- Measurement plan (what to measure, how)
- Hypotheses ranked by expected impact
- Suggested optimizations + verification steps
