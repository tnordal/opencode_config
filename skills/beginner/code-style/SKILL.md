## What I do
- Prefer small, reviewable changes
- Keep naming consistent with nearby code
- Avoid unrelated refactors mixed with functional changes

## Checklist
- Run formatters/linters when available
- Keep functions small and single-purpose
- Add tests when behavior changes
- Update docs when user-facing behavior changes

## Output format
- If you propose code edits: provide a short rationale and a minimal patch
