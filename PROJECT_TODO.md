# Project TODO (opencode_config)

Last updated: 2026-01-28

## Completed
- [x] Create core docs: `README.md`, `agents-guide.md`, `commands-guide.md`, `skills-guide.md`
- [x] Add example agents by difficulty: `agents/beginner/`, `agents/intermediate/`, `agents/advanced/`
- [x] Add example commands by difficulty: `commands/beginner/`, `commands/intermediate/`, `commands/advanced/`
- [x] Add example skills by difficulty: `skills/beginner/`, `skills/intermediate/`, `skills/advanced/`
- [x] Document integration patterns: `examples/integration-patterns.md`
- [x] Document real-world workflows: `examples/real-world-workflows.md`
- [x] Document skill permission patterns: `examples/skill-permission-examples.md`
- [x] Capture project constraints + next-work options in `session.md`
- [x] Tag initial milestone (“Version 1.0” in `README.md`)

## Next (pick one)
- [ ] Make repo runnable as-is by adding a `.opencode/` mirror
- [ ] Add a curated “starter pack” (orchestrator + subagents + commands + skills)
- [ ] Add validation docs/scripts (skill naming + frontmatter checks)

## Repo Improvement Backlog
- [ ] Add `.opencode/README.md` explaining how the mirror relates to `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`
- [ ] Add a minimal `opencode.json` example showing model + permissions + a few agents/commands
- [ ] Add a “how to test locally” doc with a couple concrete `opencode` usage examples
- [ ] Add a small changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`) for future versions
